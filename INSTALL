To run METRo, you will need the following software packages:

    * python 2.3 or greater
    * gfortran
    * SWIG
    * libxml2 (see further for the right version)
    * numpy 0.9.8 or +

== Prerequisite installation ==

   1. Install gfortran;
   2. Be sure that you have python 2.3.0 or +.
   3. Be sure that you have SWIG 1.3.20 or +.
   4. Download the package numpy with you package manager or:
          * Go to Numpy homepage and download the source: http://numpy.scipy.org/
          * Become root and install the package
	    python setup.py install
   5. You must have the library libxml2, release 2.6.9 or +. You must also have the corresponding python wrapper (python-libxml2).
          * To know the release of libxml2 you have installed, do this following command:

             ls /usr/lib | grep libxml2.so

          * The written number represent the release you have installed. To avoid all conflicts, download the tarball with the corresponding release number and install. 


=== Gentoo linux ===
Become root and

   1. Install gcc with the compiler gfortran

       USE="fortran" emerge sys-devel/gcc

   2. Install/Update python at the release 2.3 or +

       emerge -u dev-lang/python

   3. Install/Update SWIG at the release 1.3.20 or +

       emerge -u dev-lang/swig

   4. Install/Update the package libxml2 at the release 2.6.9 or +

       emerge -u dev-libs/libxml2 

   5. Install/Update the package numpy at the release 0.9.8 or +

       emerge -u dev-python/numpy

== METRo software installation ==

   1. Decompress the METRo software.

      Ex: tar xjvf metro-x.x.x.tar.bz2

   2. If there is more than one version of python on your system, set the environment variable PYTHON_INCLUDE to indicate the directory where you find the "include" of python 2.N, where 'N' is the python version..

      Ex: export PYTHON_INCLUDE=/usr/local/include/python2.N

   3. Execute the script setup.sh with the destination directory as an argument.

      Ex: ./setup.sh /usr/local

   4. To verify your installation, in the directory

       path_to_metro/usr/bin

      do this command

      python ./metro --selftest 

      if the file

       path_to_metro/usr/share/metro/data/roadcast/roadcast.xml

      was created successfully and the differences with 
       path_to_metro/usr/share/metro/data/selftest/roadcast_reference.xml
      is only the element <production-date>.
