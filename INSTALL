   2. If there is more than one version of python on your system, set the environment variable PYTHON_INCLUDE to indicate the directory where you find the "include" of python 2.3.

      Ex: export PYTHON_INCLUDE=/usr/local/include/python2.3

   3. Execute the script setup.sh with the destination directory as an argument.

      Ex: ./setup.sh /usr/local

   4. To verify your installation, in the directory

       path_to_metro/bin

      do this command

      python ./metro --selftest 

      if the file

       path_to_metro/data/roadcast/roadcast_selftest.xml

      was created successfully, your installation is working.
